# HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Prediction

## 📌 Objective
The aim of this project is to analyze employee data and predict attrition based on various work-related factors like job role, salary, overtime, work-life balance, and job satisfaction.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset
- The dataset contains employee-level data with features such as age, gender, department, salary, job satisfaction, years at company, etc.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Imported the IBM employee attrition dataset.
- Ensured data integrity and verified no missing critical information.

### 2. Data Exploration
- Identified common patterns for attrition across job roles, salary levels, and experience.
- Analyzed how factors like overtime and income affect attrition.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Removed unnecessary columns like `EmployeeNumber`, `Over18`, `StandardHours`.
- Handled categorical data using one-hot encoding (`pd.get_dummies`).
- Split the dataset into train and test sets.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized attrition distribution by job role and income.
- Used heatmaps to identify correlations between attrition and other variables.
